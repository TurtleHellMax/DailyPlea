                I just had the BEST burger of all time.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm serious.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And you won't believe where I found it.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                At the top of the mountain!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Nuts, right?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Most folks don't even know there's still people up there! But there are, and boy, can they sure steam a good ham!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                This was seriously the most savory, perfectly seasoned slab of meat I've ever sunk my teeth into, and the cheese? Perfectly mild.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It was actually magical.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The great thing about their business, is that it's so cold up there they don't even need fresh meat!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                They just keep the meat outside and it freezes solid!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I know the people in the kingdom always make a big deal about "fresh meat", but out here they can store the meat for as long as they want, and it'll still beat the socks off of everything those castle-goer's will ever make.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I really can't emphasize how good this burger was though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They must've been perfecting this recipe for CENTURIES to get it THIS perfect. And honestly, I wouldn't put it past them!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                These were some OLD folks around town.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I'm talking ancient-history-it's-a-wonder-they're-not-dust-yet old.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I honestly bet the secret is these burgers.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I mean, I felt five years younger after this experience.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Just... wow.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It was a pain and a half to climb up here, but I might come back tomorrow just for the meal!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                11/10 burger joint. Would ABSOLUTELY recommend.
