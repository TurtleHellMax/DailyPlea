            <span class="section">
                Humans are the only animal that denies their own physiology.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They make it their mission, every day, to masquerade as being excluded from the animal kingdom.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                An "other" when compared to the rest of primal culture.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's a constant endeavor, and yet it's completely futile.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                For humans simply cannot resist their most poignant instincts.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The expression they attempt to resist the most is the only one they're utterly incapable of suppressing.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Everyone's "civilized" until there's a war to be fought or a man to be punished.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Their false barrier collapses entirely the moment a cute creature needs an owner.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They passively dominate each other while reassuring each other they're equals.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They replace the hierarchy of strength with one of gold.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Despite their efforts, all of their most primal behaviors remain below the surface, but now, they're obfuscated enough to be looked past and ignored.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They deny themselves what's pleasurable in a vain attempt to ward off what's seen as harmful.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They sever the genuine connection they may have had with themselves and others, to instead replace it with one of silicon and makeup.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They try so desperately to suppress their ego and barbarism that they convince themselves they've succeeded, making them oblivious to their own nature and the ways it continues to creep into their life again and again.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Humans are not detached from animals.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They are not *truly* more civilized.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They try to convince themselves that they are.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And that false assumption's far more dangerous than the primal selves they so fear.
            </span>
