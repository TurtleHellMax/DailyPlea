                Do you ever just feel... Sluggish?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Sometimes I have weeks where I'm on top of things;
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I leap out of bed in the morning and get a thousand tasks done in an hour!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And then other times, I have months where I just... Don't really feel like doing anything...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I mean, I still do things!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                But... It's not easy.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And the things I DO get done take longer than I think they should.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The days feel too short.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think it mostly happens when I'm dreading something.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Like when I have an alchemy exam coming up, and I feel unprepared.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Or when the new year's on the horizon...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's not even that I'm SAD... Just that I lack energy.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I have motivation!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I WANT to get things done!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But... My body doesn't.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I feel like my mind and body are constantly at odds with one another.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The weeks of ceasefire allow them to cooperate, but then once they're back on, they spend more energy dueling than they do getting anything important done!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Imagine how powerful I could be if those weeks of coordination lasted!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But it's not to be...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm gonna try to hold myself to a harsher schedule, starting tomorrow.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Who knows? Maybe I'll finally get these guys to sign a peace treaty!
            </span>
