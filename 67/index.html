            <span class="section">
                Clouds are quite beautiful.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm sure this isn't a new observation, but it's shockingly not one I've seen touched on before.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Poets often gaze upon star-splashed skies and luminant sunsets, but I've yet to see one admire the colossal white splotches that fill the horizon.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I think they should.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Because a sun set on a clear sky is far less visually stunning than one placed upon a slightly cloudy one.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Low-flying clouds are the best for evenings, I think.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They bounce the light in such a fascinating way, producing slight hues across their surface, contrasting with the heavens and mountains.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Fog can also be so wonderful from afar...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Though I'm not sure whether or not it's one and the same as clouds...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I believe it must be...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                They look quite identical, after all.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I've read that clouds are made of rain droplets, but how they stay suspended up there, and how they decide when to fall, is beyond me.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The fact checks out as far as I can tell, though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When have you ever seen rain without clouds? Clouds can also be a joy to illustrate.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                On occasion, I mark the outline of a cloud upon my page, and then finish it with whatever comes to mind.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Snails, flowers, even faces; You can always think of something odd to finish the sketch with.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Oh clouds...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                What an under-recognized marvel you are.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Perhaps I'll write some poetry of my own in their regard someday.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Yes, I believe I will.
            </span>
