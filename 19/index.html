            <span class="section">
                Today, Ramon came in for his weekly refill of cheese a bit sooner than he normally does.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I mentioned it to him, and he said his platters have been getting raided by a bunch of new grunts coming into the shop!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (His words, not mine! XD)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I don't think he was actually that upset, I'm sure, because he told me he's making good money from it all, but he likes to be dramatic for effect.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (I personally get a real kick out of it!)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                He's probably the biggest character in town, so it always makes my day when I see him around.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                He told me some of the people marching into his shop said they were recommended by Pterry... Which he and I both found very odd, and rather amusing.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I told him I suspect Pterry's not actually RECOMMENDING his shop, as much as he might've just casually mentioned it during normal conversation, and he agreed.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I DO know Pterry has a bit of a soft spot, even if it IS tucked deep beneath his fancy armor!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                So who knows...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I joked with Ramon that maybe he just decided it's time he turned over a new leaf!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Ramon said it's either that... or he bonked his head!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                We both laughed!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Ah... Oh dear, I suppose I better start supplying a bit more cheese and crackers eh? XD
            </span>
