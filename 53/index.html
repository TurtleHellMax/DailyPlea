                The kingship thinks knighthood to be noble.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It seems 'most everyone shares that sentiment.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But what's noble about it?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Is there anything noble about fighting someone else's battle?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                War is a cruel and harrowing affair.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The men who go in never come out.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Even those who survive die somewhere along the way, if not physically, mentally.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                All notions of nobility are lost when the first man falls.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When it all becomes real.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Training can prepare you for the fight, but it can never ready you for the aftermath.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I've seen the old knights.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The looks in their eyes.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The glimmer that was lost.

                War is a battle of ego.
            </span><br><br>
            <span class="section">
                The leaders know who's won before it starts, and long before it ends.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And yet they send their men to die by the others' blade regardless, never surrendering when they should.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Not because they have any hope of winning, but because the last thing they want is to lose.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So men are thrust into a fight they could never hope to win, and there, they're slaughtered.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Both sides give their all, but that's precisely what evens the effort.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When the blade finds its way into the seams of the armor and pierces the crimson vessel of its enemy, there's no triumph.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                There's no celebration.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                No fanfare.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Only the groans of a man.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                A father desperate to come home to his daughter.
            </span><br>

                A husband who had a welcome party planned in advance.

                A friend who had a drink waiting for him at the pub.

            <span class="section">
                And now he doesn't.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And that's that.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Do you think they'll remember his name?

                Do you think they'll honor his memory?

                No.

                The losers rarely do.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's the victors who log the battles.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The king decrees a victory, but there's no winning for the knights that remain. Only surviving.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They hold their arms up and smile by the King's request, mustering up all the joy they can within their tattered soul, but once they step back through their front door, the pit returns to their stomach.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They wonder what they're going to say to his wife.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                How they're going to explain their return over his.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                How the other barstool will never again be filled... not in the same way.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's a brutal irony;
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                There's no victory for those who fought the hardest for it.
            </span><br><br>
            <span class="section">
                So is knighthood noble?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Or is that just how they manipulate ambitious spirits to better fulfill the violent whims of an arbitrary leader?
