                I feel its invisible breath on my neck.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It sends a shiver down my spine.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Its creeping gaze follows me from an imperceivable hiding place.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It judges my every move.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Records each detail.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The way I behave.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The sound of my steps.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It knows what I'll do next.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's in my head.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Nothing is secret, not even the voice inside.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It sees through me like a linen cloth.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Its perversion knows no bounds.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think an evil thought, and then second-guess it.

            <span class="section">
                Does it know?

                Of course it does.

                It must.

                I should apologize...

                NO.

                What should I apologize for anyway?

                I have no respect for this observer!

                Wait, how long have I been thinking?

                Did my face give away my thoughts?

                Oh lord, I've all but confessed!

                It knew all along, and knows I wished to deceive it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                "I'M SORRY!" I shout.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It doesn't respond.

                Will it forgive me?

                Was it even aware of the subject of my apology?

                It surely is now...

                A sound?..

                Just my own mind playing tricks...

                I feel it's determining its next action...

                Will it reveal itself?
