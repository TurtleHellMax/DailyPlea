            <span class="section">
                Today there was a big bang coming from the apprentice's lab dude!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It was like- kind of scary loud, but I calmed everyone down and said I'd check up on it, so I wasn't really scared.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I went in there to check on him (like I said I would just now), and he was COVERED in soot!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                When I asked him if he was chill or not, he freaked out that I was in there, and told me he had it all under control!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Like come on man, I'm just doing my job, no need to be a jerk about it bro.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                He's always SOOOOO secretive too, it's honestly annoying.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Like, it kind of just makes me want to know what he's up to even MORE, you know?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They don't tell us what he's working on or anything- like I said, but I heard it's a cool weapon or something...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Something to replace the blade they say... Yeah right! Like that's ever gonna happen.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                They already tried to do that with crossbows and look where it got 'em? Everyone just started having to wear heavier armor!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Personally? I think he's a hack.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I mean SURE, he made SOME cool stuff like the water power things, but I think if I wanted to, I could have done that EASILY.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                How hard could it be? It's just a thing spinning!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Anyway, they don't pay me to think, so who cares what he's up to!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Well actually... they don't really... pay me...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                at all...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                BUT they DO give me this sweet armor, food, and a room, so I've got no complaints broh!
