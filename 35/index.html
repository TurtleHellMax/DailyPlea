            <span class="section">
                Mary caught an especially nasty headache today.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I couldn't bear to see her battling such unpleasantness alone... So I Intervened.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Out came the old, leather carcass of a civilization gone by, and straight to the chapter on remedial stews thumbed her finger.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                [I merely insisted *she* make it... I, of course, can't do so alone ;) ]
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Her sweet, sultry voice hummed, "One portion of water, and for every ounce... 233 mg Purple Cycleom?.. as well as 7.425 grams of Saerow Ctystal? How are they so precise!?"
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And once again, she mused on a fascinating question that had never even crossed my mind, in her own, brilliant way.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I truly *don't know* where these hyper-specific, yet seemingly arbitrary numbers come from!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In fact, I don't think my mother did either...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Perhaps those old prophets of the time specified these things to instill greater confidence in followers?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Something to delve further into to be sure...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When she was finally finished, she had procured enough stew for the Yetis to join us at the table!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (She never *was* very good at portioning these things, haha)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I ended up trying some, and it was quite potent... But not intolerable either...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Rather, almost pleasant!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Almost.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I wouldn't have made it for kicks, and the taste was rather bitter and unusual, but it wasn't at all as unbearable as I had imagined it would be.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (Especially with so much salt!)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The mushroom's probably the trick... It always is.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                After dinner, Mary was feeling better than ever!..
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Though, I believe she had to urinate a bit more than usual, haha!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (I suppose the meal *was* mostly liquid...)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I was very joyed to see it had worked though...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Somehow those ancient scribbles always do...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                One wonders what she would *do* without me and my old books... ;)
            </span>
