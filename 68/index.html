            <span class="section">
                People are always talking about the joy of completing things, but no one ever mentions the joy of giving up on things.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Like, I get the same feeling of relief from giving up on a stressful project in school that I would from finishing it!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Is that normal?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Like, I remember the feeling I got, when the stress of writing my essay on the history of architecture was lifted just a couple of weeks ago, and it wasn't any better than the happiness I feel now, having given up on a big presentation about stupid carriages.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Like, I didn't need the points on the assignment, and I was all stressed out about researching and finding someone to interview, but then I just decided not to, and poof; Now it's over!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I guess giving up isn't something people want to glamorize, but it's really great sometimes!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I mean, when you've invested a lot of time, I guess it can be a bit of a bummer...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I don't even really care about that.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I spent the last two days reading up on carriage construction and horse breeds, and I still don't feel anywhere near as bad about wasting my time and effort on that, compared to how freeing giving up is.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I should give up more often!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Heck, I might start a project just to abandon it, I'm feeling great!
            </span>
