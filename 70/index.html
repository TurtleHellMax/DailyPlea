            <span class="section">
                In my youth, I was given few options.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Fewer options than the little I'm given now, anyway.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Within these options, there were choices that were "right" and ones that were "wrong".
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And I knew them from one another prior to choosing.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Sometimes I would weigh the "wrong" decision to see if it would benefit me.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                To see if I could outwit the consequences.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Even so, rarely did I choose them. And when I did, I rarely *did* get away with it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I knew they were the worse option regardless.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Growing up, though, I've been faced with more and more grey decisions.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Queries with an indefinite solution.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Problems, where there were no "good" options.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Where the best option was a matter of perspective.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And now I'm faced with another. And I'm unsure of which option is best.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm uncertain what answer will sting the least.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And it pains me so.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And once I have taken my pick, there will be days to pass, before I hear of its outcome.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Both my options and my hair thin and grey as I ruminate.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The doubt of my selection clouds my mind like a recurring caw.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I doubt I will see victory in this battle.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In *this* hour... I can only hope for a strategic retreat.
            </span>
