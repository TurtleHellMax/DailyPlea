            <span class="section">
                I fear the unknown.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                That's nothing new.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Everyone always does.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                But why should I fear opportunity?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I yearn for it every waking moment, and then when it finally comes, I want to cower.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                My nerves tell me to be afraid.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I focus only on the daunting and potential for failure, with the potential for great success falling by the wayside.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                We focus very little on the good in life.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Far too often, we get caught up in protecting ourselves from failure or hurt and miss all the potential for great things.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm gonna seize this opportunity.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Failure's not an option.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Self-doubt be damned, I'm gonna pull this off.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And if I don't? I will next time.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And if I don't next time? I will, the time after that.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                There's no punishment for failure.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'll feel shame, maybe... But that's all in my head.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And what I'll receive more of, is experience.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I must first learn how to fail, to even begin learning to succeed.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And so I will try.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And when I fail, I'll try again, and when I fail again, at least I'll fail in a new way.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Eventually, I'll run out of ways to fail.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I won't have any option but to succeed.
