            <span class="section">
                The history of clothing and its relationship with our society is a longer thread to unravel than it may at first seem.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                A common question among children is, "Why must I wear pants, while the animals outside don't?" And while some parents may initially think this answer to be straightforward, most quickly discover the question's seemingly simple appearance is deceiving.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Why *do* we wear clothes?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Why is it unacceptable for us to be naked when we are equipped with parts, no different from the wild things that skitter through the brush, uninhibited?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                While I can't definitively say what the real difference is myself, I *can* tell you when this attitude toward clothing is believed to have begun and how it was initially justified.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The history of clothing goes all the way back to our ancient ancestors, often referred to as "Cave Dwellers."
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Scientists believe that prior to entering the underground, humanity lived a brief period in which they only wore what was essential.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They didn't wear clothes to be modest, like we do today, but rather, only wore them to stay warm and protect against skin irritation.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Though this all changed when they retreated into The Great Mountain.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Now, what specifically *happened* during this period is notoriously unclear and endlessly debated, but what we know for a fact is that it was during this time that culture shifted to a more "modest" one, regarding apparel expectations.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                People began dressing and covering up, not out of necessity, but as a result of the religion at the time.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's believed that any members who refused to follow these newly established norms were banished from the mountain, and most likely died as a result.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Those who remained did so clothed, and so continued the tradition to this very day, that all people who possess "God-Given Intellect" shall keep their parts private.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                While we abandoned many traditions from the cavernous culture of our past, this practice in particular remains to this day, and shows no signs of changing anytime soon.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So you'd better get comfortable... But not TOO comfortable :P
            </span><br><br>
            <span class="section">
                Thank you for reading!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Next week, we'll discuss the historical significance of 'The Fallen Man', and try to pin down why its common interpretations vary so drastically from one another.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Until then, stay curious, stay nuanced, and goodbye :)
