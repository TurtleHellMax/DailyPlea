            <span class="section">
                Some people become so caught up in creating art that they start to miss out on the life that once inspired it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Every sight is reduced to inspiration.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Every book is derivative and cliche.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In their pursuit of appreciation, they begin to miss the art for the details.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm that person.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I can no longer see a piece without deconstructing its creation.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Without getting into the ultimately underwhelming headspace of the craftsman.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                There's not a machine around that I haven't solved.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                There's no mystery to any of it anymore.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                No wonder.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                No intrigue.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I enjoyed solving things in the beginning.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Learning to analyze.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But soon, the study consumed me.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                The once learned practices became innate.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                My mind set off on its own.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I gave it the tools to ruin the only thing that was truly interesting in this life, and now it's ruining me.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I wish I could go back.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I yearn to ogle at things beyond my understanding.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I wish I could ooh at a faucet and ahh at a gate.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The more we cherish the novel, the faster we race to its end.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The faster you chase after the bunny, the further it goes.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Somewhere along the line, after the years had piled, my stride became automatic.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                My legs chased on their own.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And eventually, the cunning rabbit veered at a fork, and my legs carried on without him.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Without a destination, they press on still.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                No longer because they have a goal or purpose, but because by now, the sprint is all they can remember.
