                Do you ever look up and imagine reaching the stars?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I mean, landing on one.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Maybe even take a little piece home with you!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It would be fantastic...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I bet you could light a whole kingdom for centuries with a scoop of one!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That got me thinking, though...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                About space...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And about the things *in* space...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                You know what I'm talking about.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Creatures from another world!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If we could venture across the sky, maybe other things could too!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Maybe, if you go high enough, you'll find another planet, just like ours!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Perhaps on the way, you'll encounter another being, just like you.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The barrier to entry must be quite high to soar up there, though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I can't even imagine how you'd do it!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                But maybe that's a good thing...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Perhaps that means anyone able to visit will be enlightened enough to do so with good intentions!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Or maybe... that's too optimistic...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Intelligence and ability don't necessarily make someone a good person...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Oh, look at me go, giving myself more nightmares.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Maybe visiting space wouldn't be so great after all.
            </span>
