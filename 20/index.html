            <span class="section">
                I told the king I'd deliver his letter in 2 days, but it turns out I only needed one!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I guess I'm faster than I thought.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Anyways, when I delivered the letter I was asked by the Northern King to stay for dinner or until he finished writing his response, so I could take it back with me to the kingdom.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I was kind of hoping to take it easy on the hop back, but I probably should've guessed he'd want to respond!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                He was very distressed reading the letter though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                He assured me that this was all, "truly, a misunderstanding!"
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I nodded along, but I have no clue what he's talking about.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think he thought I had read the letter before giving it to him or something.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                (I didn't! Was I supposed to???)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But from what I gathered, our king's accusing him of something bad, and he's denying it.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                He really looked puzzled while reading the letter, so I kinda believe him, but then again, I guess he could just be a good actor :P
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But yeah, I stayed for dinner and they really went all out!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                They were treating me like *I* was the king, trying to impress me and stuff.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think they're just trying to do everything they can to make a good impression on our kingdom.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Which kind of makes me a little more suspicious, but I don't know.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Like I said, this whole situation really DID seem like news to him!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Oh I don't know. Guess that's why I stay out of politics!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Well, anyhoo, dinner was great, like I said, and I ended up staying the night in this CRAZY luxurious room.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                They gave me a butler guy and everything!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm making the big journey back tomorrow, so I better get to bed now.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Hopefully this all works itself out soon, because I don't know how many more back-to-back long-distance deliveries I have in me!
            </span>
