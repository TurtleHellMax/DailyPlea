            <span class="section">
                Today I finally finished reading 'Time's Eye: New Dawn' and... Well...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm kinda pissed!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The whole book was fine, I guess... I even got emotionally invested!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But the way it ended just sort of soured everything.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It was so anticlimactic and obvious that the author was just trying to milk the franchise!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Like, there was totally a draft of the story that ended in one book, but then at the last second, they changed it to the one I GOT, so I'd have to waste my time reading another!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Ending things on a cliffhanger is FINE... IF you resolve SOMETHING!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But ending it after adding more questions!?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                The gall!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I mean, why did Simon betray them at the very last moment?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                What's up with the forest?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Does the jewel even do what they said it did?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's heavily implied NOT TO now!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When I started reading, I loved how things paid off; it seemed like all the different plot points always tied together, but toward the end, it's like they just... stopped doing that!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Are they going to be resolved in the next installment?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I doubt it!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It just feels... well, like I said, it feels like they just chopped off the original payoff to insert some cobbled-together cliffhanger so they could keep the story going, and rob me of more hard-earned metal.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I don't know if I'll even buy the next book...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Okay, who am I kidding? I probably will.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I WON'T be happy about it!
            </span>
