            <span class="section">
                I just had the BEST loaf of bread of all time.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm serious. And you won't believe where I found it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In the town neighboring the kingdom! Now I know this place gets sort of a bad rap when it comes to... Well... liveliness?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I mean it's a quaint town, don't get me wrong, but everything's very... Old-timey.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But hey, if there's one thing I've learned in all my travels: it's that these old-timers can COOK.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                This loaf was SO GOOD.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It honestly wasn't even very bread-y at all? But I don't mean that as a bad thing!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Like it didn't crumble much, and it was pretty moist?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I don't know man! I can't do it justice in words! It was SERIOUSLY GOOD THOUGH!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think it was just that it was doughy, but I'm talking, the PERFECT amount of doughy.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Almost like rubber when sinking my teeth in..? But in a good way!?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And it was sweet too!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Like not 'sugar' sweet, but maybe... apple sweet?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (IT WASN'T TOO SWEET IS THE POINT!)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Oh, and it was pretty filling!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I paid like 1 copper piece for a whole loaf, and was filled after only 2 slices.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And I was STARVING BEFORE THAT!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I don't know WHAT they put in this stuff, but honestly? I'm afraid to ask.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think I prefer to just enjoy it :)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Anyway, the old lady who served it was very polite and wholesome, so my final verdict is: 10/10 bread, shockingly solid loaf. Would TOTALLY recommend.
