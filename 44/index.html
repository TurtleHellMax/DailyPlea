                My classes begin tomorrow.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I know them to be no more evil than is necessary, and yet I face only dread in their wake.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I always do.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I know they're never as arduous as my mind makes them out to be, and yet my mind persists in its mission to forge them into colossi.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's as though my mind were split into separate parts, one my own; Rational, reasonable, logical, and the other completely detached; emotional, impulsive, and irrational.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I wish it weren't.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If nothing else, it'd make sleeping much easier.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But my schooling is inevitable.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                The relief from its wrath came and went as all things do.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Time is a cunning thief...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Robbing you of your moments most valuable, leaving you only with what isn't worth its weight to carry.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Maybe this time I'll find something worth looking forward to in my education...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Though I fear the odds haven't been in my favor thus far.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If nothing else, these classes boost my confidence in my abilities...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Perhaps, by the time they reach their end, my shoulders will be prepared to bear the kingdom's impending weight...
            </span><br><br>
            <span class="section">
                Or so one hopes...
