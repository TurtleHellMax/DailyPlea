                I'm FURIOUS today...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Well, not really...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm mostly just sad.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Disappointed even.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I guess I see what teachers are always talking about, haha.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Dad forgot to get the mail today.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                That's fine.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Everybody forgets things every now and then, but do you know what I had waiting in that mailbox?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                A letter from my northern sweetheart!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                "Okay, big deal, just go get the mail right now!" I hear you naively say.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Well, guess what? I CAN'T.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                "Why?" You ask?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                BECAUSE IT WAS EATEN BY A GOAT.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                "How?" You ask?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (You're pretty curious, aren't you?)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Well, APPARENTLY, today OF ALL DAYS was the day the king had more livestock imported.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Which, again, would be FINE if it weren't for the fact that the delivery company had just recently hired the CLUMSIEST wrangler in the WORLD.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When it came time to put the animals in their pens, he opened the carriage... And then jumped out of the way when the goats ran out.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                One of the goats, however, noticed a goat sized gap between the gate and carriage, which he of course, DASHED through to run amok in the town.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                WHICH WOULD BE JUST FINE IF IT HADN'T HOMED IN ON MY MAILBOX AS ITS HANDPICKED BUFFET!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And that's how my letter was dispersed among the goat's 4 stomachs and the crap that comes from them, rather than me.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I guess I'll just have to send a letter to my love, explaining the situation...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But it's pretty upsetting that his elegantly written literature is forever lost to a goat's bowels...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                From now on, I'm gonna get the mail MYSELF first thing every morning.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                This is NOT happening again.
