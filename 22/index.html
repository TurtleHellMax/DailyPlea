            <span class="section">
                Answering kids' questions is harder than you'd think.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                To them, you're an all-knowing god, and everything you say is gospel.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I hesitate to bask in the joy of impacting these kids' lives though, because I worry about how it'll effect who they grow up to be, or whether or not my impact is as positive as I hope it is.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I like to think of myself as a decently wise and well-rounded person, but nobody's without their flaws.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                And I'm sure there're plenty of flaws I'm completely oblivious to.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In fact I'd wager that MOST of my flaws are completely unknown to me!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And then there's the matter of opinion.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Who am I to decide how one should or shouldn't act?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                How one should or shouldn't be?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                What's right and what's wrong?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                What I think is right, can just as easily be argued to be wrong.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And who's right in the end?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Nobody!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                What give's me the right to lead these children?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think about that a lot.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It's something that's troubled me for a lifetime.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Whenever I find myself spiraling over this though, I often go back to what my dearest told me many decades ago...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                "If you're THIS concerned about your impact, then you're already doing a better job than the parents who decided to bring these kids into the world to begin with!"
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                She was partially joking of course, but I find comfort in the notion nonetheless.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I may not be the pinnacle of humanity, or a deity by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm trying my darnedest, and am, at the very least, doing a better job than the countless people who don't so much as *begin* to concern themselves with these doubts.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I guess I just gotta keep on doing my best.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's what I want my students to do anyways.
            </span>
