            <span class="section">
                Sometimes I dread things.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I dread parts of projects I start, or luncheons I can't avoid.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And with this dread, I end up obsessing over what I can't control.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It consumes my every thought.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I become paralyzed by the concept of an inevitability.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I lollygag my way through my day, putting off the dreaded action as long as I can. And sometimes... there's no deadline.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                No date or time marks the clearing of this awful fog from my head.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Sometimes, it's up to me to determine the task's completion.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's when it's the worst.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I seem to slow to a crawl in whatever I work on to lead up to it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I fill my plate with every appetizer I can fathom, in the hopes that I'll be full by the time the main meal arrives.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I never am.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                There is no "full".
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Not until the meal is over, and I've gulped down my vegetables.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And so I prolong the dinner, as though I'm competing for an endurance record.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And it's miserable.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Oh, how it's miserable.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The meal must be eaten.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I must learn to tolerate it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I must take the first bite... but something inside me makes it so unfathomably difficult.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I must learn how to overcome this dread.
            </span>
