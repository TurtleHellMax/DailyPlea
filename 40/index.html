            <span class="section">
                Where does the line between ambition and delusion lie? Are they one in the same?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Were those now labeled "Ambitious" just delusional people who got lucky?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They say genius goes unappreciated during its time... Were those geniuses seen as morons before their fame?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I believe the answer is yes.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's nearly impossible to tell what will and won't succeed in its time.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If it was as easy as people seem to think it is, you'd think our kingdom would be a lot richer from its investments.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So if people have such a notoriously impossible time predicting something's success... Why are they so eager to predict its failure?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Is it statistics?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                More things fail than succeed?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Is it caution?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Better to plan for the worst outcome?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm not excluding myself from those that do this. I'm just as pessimistic as everyone else...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I wish the universal pessimism was much lower than it seems to be.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If the investment asked of you won't break the bank by any means, it'll make someone very happy, and has the possibility for ASTRONOMICAL returns... Why not take the risk?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Because it's not 'normal'?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Because everyone without such an opportunity tells you it's too risky?
            </span><br><br>
            <span class="section">
                I guess I'm either an ambitious genius... or a delusional moron.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Only time will tell which.
