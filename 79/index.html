            <span class="section">
                There's a strange sense of pride I feel in seeing *my* team win.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's a completely barbaric, primal, and illogical feeling.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But it's a good one.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                There's some part of me that feels as if I played a role in their victory.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                As though *my* career was just furthered.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I try to behave rationally and live beyond my surface emotions, but the feeling I get when the confetti matches *my* team's color is one I'm guilty of indulging in.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The trait is almost definitely rooted in our evolution.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Those who felt the pack's success as their own were probably better members of it, and thus, survived and reproduced more often...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And when our pack was celebrating a successful hunt, this was a beautiful thing.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                But now I see the same urge widening the moat between people.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When these clans grow to exceed our field of view, they fade into the background, and we develop smaller clans within them, disconnecting from the intelligent creature race as a whole, in favor of a subdivision.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When there's no longer any "other" group to point the stick at, we start searching for it within ourselves, turning the stick inward.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                We cheer for our warriors triumphing in battle, and detach from those who are dead and defeated.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When we indulge in *some* of our toxic traits, we introduce new predicaments.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                What's the acceptable amount of poisonous sludge consumption?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                At what point have we crossed that line?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Will we know exactly when the lines have been crossed, or will we only notice once we're past the point of no return?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I therefore try to resist these innate behaviors... at least when it comes to contests of life and death.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I continue to indulge in sport.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                My awareness of the dilemma that such behavior creates does not deter me from engaging in it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I derive pleasure from it!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And at least I've painted a line!..
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Though over time, paint runs...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                And what once was a pronounced, bright white, becomes a smeared, faded grey.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I can only hope that when that happens, I recall what I've written here...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Such is the cost of living.
            </span>
