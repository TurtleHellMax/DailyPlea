            <span class="section">
                I got a letter delivered by Skipper today. At first glance it looked pretty important.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Mostly because of the big red wax seal...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                and maybe somewhat due to the huge letters reading, "IMPORTANT!"
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Apparently, The kingdom's having its 100th anniversary festival this year, and they want ME to cater it!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (I guess news got out of my cooking)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                This would be great news if... well... if I WANTED to cater to the kingdom... But I don't know...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The kingdom itself isn't BAD, but it's not as good as I think it could be, and... well... I don't believe in monarchs.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I mean, they've gotten rid of the whole, "selected by god" part of it all, but that doesn't change the fact that the leader is still based entirely on bloodline.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Seriously? You think this guy's qualified to be a leader just because... what? He's half-you?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I don't know if I'd even describe YOU as a good leader, let alone your dim-witted kid!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Truthfully, I don't know about this prince in particular, but I've personally seen some real stupid kids come out of people I'd consider to be pretty bright.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If I were in charge, I'd pick the leader from the winners of some big competition, or... even just run a vote or something, I don't know!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                But I guess that's why I live way up here, and not down there.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I don't mesh well with... most of society as it stands today. Or rather, as it's ever stood, I suppose.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I was an outcast back when I had a kingdom, and I'm an outcast now.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But apparently I make good enough burgers for them to look past all that.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                On the one hand, I hold nothing against the PEOPLE of the kingdom, and would love to stuff them with my delicious delicacies, but on the other... I'd be doing so by the King's request, whom I fundamentally disagree with.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So yeah, suffice to say, I'm still on the fence about it.
            </span>
