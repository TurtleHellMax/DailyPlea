            <span class="section">
                The flower has evolved for billions of years.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's mutated, split, and diversified, but it's only in its early years.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Eventually, given infinite time, there will be a perfect flower.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                As it approaches this inevitable peak, all the flowers that came before it will fade out into obscurity.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's evolution.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The black and yellow audience only pollinates what it deems appealing.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                To reach perfection, the flower must evolve into more and more appealing variations.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If any variations should fail to appeal, they will swiftly meet their end.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In the beginning, this flora fought for scraps.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If they wanted to survive, they needed an edge.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                This drove them to evolve wildly and sprout into many plants we now know today, not even as flowers.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But those that kept the stem and petals soon reached a point of comfort.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Sustaining this comfort became the new goal.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Taking risks was no longer necessary for those who had survived this far.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In fact, it became dangerous.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Risk came with little reward, and the potential to completely outdate the plants that failed to meet the new paradigm established.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                There became more incentive to fight those attempting to evolve than to evolve oneself.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Eventually, one would slip through, wipe the rest out, but everything was stacked against it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And once this new, more perfect flower came along, it simply established its own standards and protected itself the same way its competition did before it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When survival relies on success, failure's not an option, and any gamble with its involvement becomes a no-brainer.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And so, while the blossoms hold the freedom to evolve, the very market that originally propagated their innovation is the very same one that stifles it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Their reliance on mass appeal becomes an invisible, unspoken barrier.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Given infinite time, the perfect flower will grow.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Its beauty maximized.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Its form, pure.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But given infinite time, there will be no soil left to root in.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Given infinite time, there won't even be a 'you' to see them go.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Perhaps, if the roots shared, and the soil sustained, flowers more diverse could sprout.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Perhaps, we would see many flowers, each most beautiful to a few, rather than one flower on its way to appeal to all.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Perhaps, given the chance to be ugly, they could learn to be beautiful.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Perhaps then, you'd actually see YOUR perfect flower...
