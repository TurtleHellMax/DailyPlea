                Everything vital has already been made!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The only thing left to make are scraps that go unappreciated and unrecognized.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                We already have all of the problems in our lives solved!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The only thing left to do is replace the man! We have carriages, bells, drawbridges, furnaces...

                What else do the people need?

                If only I were born earlier... It would have been a slice of cake to create the first cart or spinning wheel!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But now I'm left to create new problems, in order to solve them...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Then again, perhaps cavemen thought the same thing shortly after discovering fire...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'll bet they yearned to be the first to invent the slightly-sharpened stick first!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's easy to see inventions through today's lens as simple, I suppose...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But in their time, they may very well have seemed just as advanced as whatever *my* great invention shall be...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Maybe we'll see...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                As soon as I complete the "inventing" part of the process, that is.
