            <span class="section">
                Sometimes, when there's nothing else to do... I whiddle.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Nothing in particular, just whatever sticks I've got lying around.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Sometimes, I try to get ambitious and make a sculpture from a thicker branch... but most times I just stick to sharpening sticks.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                There's really no point to it but to pass the time.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Sometimes I make little things as gifts, or room ornaments, but the vast majority of the time, I just whiddle garbage for the sake of it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think there's a lot to be learned from the whiddling process.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                We creatures love instant gratification.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Whiddling doesn't really give you that.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Instead, it teaches you to be patient and savor each and every little bit of progress.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                See, most people ignore small progress, or don't even notice it, only lookin' at the start and end of a project.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And that's fine enough for short-lived stuff.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But if you wanna work on bigger things, that just won't cut it!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You'll get the start, but man, it could be a couple of years before you see that end!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Whiddling's sort of like that, except it delays it a couple of hours or days.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But the lack of stimulation you get from the repetitive process, gives you a pretty good sense of what those big-project-years might feel like...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                What was I saying?..
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Oh, I don't know.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I like whiddling.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's slow, pointless, and yet... somehow, pretty fun.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                There's some big lesson there, I think.
            </span>
