                Y'know, it's a lotta work to have a well-formed opinion.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I mean, it's real easy just to base it off a knee-jerk feeling.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Even when you try to look up facts and piece together the truth...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's hard not to just pick out what you wanna hear.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                To not choose the stuff that proves your initial reaction right.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And everyone struggles with this...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's what makes it so difficult to stray from the common opinion!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If how I feel about something is how everyone else feels, it must be right!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I know that's not true... But it just feels right!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                How can we all be wrong?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And it's alienatin' to differ from the norm.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You get along better if you just blindly follow what everyone else does, plus it's easier!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Really, there's no reason to get to the bottom of what's true!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Ignorance is bliss, as they say. Knowledge is a curse!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                To know the truth while everyone around you gobbles up nonsense is hard.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's hard not to get angry at them for it!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Especially when you try to lead 'em to water but they just won't drink!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Then they might start resentin' YOU!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's why I don't talk to people much.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I always wanna show them the light, but... well, debatin' rarely leads to real growth.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Most of the time, it just solidifies their stance to themselves and makes 'em resent everythin' else.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The fear of being wrong is the scariest one of all.
