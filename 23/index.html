            <span class="section">
                I had a horrible dream last night.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (Well, I guess that makes it a nightmare..? That's beside the point.)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In it, everything seemed normal... but I knew none of it was real.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It was as if I had woken up, and was living my life with everything behaving relatively realistically, but I could tell it was all 'off'.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I knew I was trapped in some sort of illusion.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The people around me acted SORT OF like themselves, but I knew they weren't.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And nobody would listen to me.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                No one would listen when I said that it wasn't real.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They all just kept trying to convince me that it was.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That made me start fearing that I would lose my grip on reality, and start believing it was real myself.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It was horrifying.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I spent all my time in the dream trying to get back to the real world.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I didn't know how I had gotten there.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I never even considered it to be a dream.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I just knew it wasn't real.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In the end, I gave up trying to escape...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                And then, JUST as I slammed my head down on my desk in defeat, I woke back up.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It took me a few moments to orient myself.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It had all felt so real. (Or, I suppose, UNreal)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I was still paranoid and shaken.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I remembered it all very vividly too.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I really thought I would be trapped in there forever.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I remember when I was younger I had a similar dream, where I panicked, thinking I hadn't set my alarm, and that I would never wake up... But at least in that one, I knew it was a dream.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In this one, I didn't even consider that.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I had no idea what it WAS, just that it wasn't real.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That I was trapped.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It was so dreadful... Being lonely despite being surrounded by what appeared, and behaved ALMOST like people I really knew...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I was disturbed for the rest of the day.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I hope I'll be over it tomorrow.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I didn't confide in anyone about it, but if I'm still obsessing after tonight's rest, I think I may need to.
            </span>
