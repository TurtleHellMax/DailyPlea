    <p>Plea #1:<br>
      <br>
      The man took any job he could get, for he was qa scoundrel and they cam very few and far in between. The man was quite adept at looking busy despite doing very little of anything productive. This could be viewed as a skill more than anything else, much like acting is most certainly a skill, and considering how little capitalism rewards actual productivity, it may as well be the greatest skill you have to be fair. But the man didn't consider such frivolties. He didnt ponder much at all, for he valued few things in life more than his wife and football. If you were to ask what makes for a successful and well lived life to most people, theyd respond. "happiness", but I believe this man is living proof that that tired old answer is just not true, because look at this guy: he's truly happy, happier than you'll probably ever be, dear reader, and he does absolutely nothing to become so. He doesnt create, doesnt work much, doesnt introspect... he does nothing, and is content in that. perhaps you and I are being a bit too cynical though... maybe we're just jealous of his contented demeanor... no that cant be it. Look at this guy! The most risk hes ever taken is trying cilantro on his pancakes! He's an absolute bafoon! he cant be living life better than us! Anyways... you're order comes out to $28.83, pull through to the next window please.</p>
