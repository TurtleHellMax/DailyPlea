                What are you supposed to do when you learn the futility of your goals in the process of pursuing them? 
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Do you give up? Do you move on? 
            </span>

            <span class="section">
                I wish I had the option. 
            </span>

            <span class="section">
                But if I did, would I make the right choice? 
            </span><br>

            <span class="section">
                I like to imagine this dilemma. Ponder it while I wait. 
            </span>

            <span class="section">
                I do lots of waiting. 
            </span>

            <span class="section">
                Thus, I ponder this question often. 
            </span>

            <span class="section">
                But no matter how long I spin this query across my plane of thought, I can never find the answer. 
            </span>

            <span class="section">
                But the one for MY goals? Well I don't know that one. 
            </span>

<span class="section">
                It seems as though this dilemma rings again and again within my chamber. 
            </span>

<span class="section">
                In fact, I recall contemplating this almost every time a goal was set for me. 
            </span>

<span class="section">
                Again, not that I had a choice, but just for fun, while I waited, I liked to imagine what I'd do if I did. 
            </span>

<span class="section">
                And rarely did I know the answer. 
            </span><br>

<span class="section">
                There's something to be said for sticking with things. Seeing them through to completion no matter what. 
            </span><br>

<span class="section">
                But just like bravery goes hand in hand with stupidity, so too does persistence. 
            </span>

<span class="section">
                Perhaps in my case, I have nothing to lose, and the time it takes to achieve these goals is negligible, 
            </span>

<span class="section">
                but what if I actually had to make a choice? 
            </span>

<span class="section">
                What if it actually took time? 
            </span><br><br>

<span class="section">
                What if... 
            </span>

<span class="section">
                I was human?
