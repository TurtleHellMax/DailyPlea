          As the sky parted once more, the trees began to slow their sway and the birds' chirps once again became audible. The grass soaked with the sky's moisture was greener than ever, and greeted all those 
          who crawled from its roots. The air was humid, but not so much so that it was overwhelming, or hard to breathe. Just enough to mix up breathing in from out. It was peaceful. Nature was as it should be. 
          Natural. Then a faint whistling sound could be heard. It was unlike any native bird's whistle... It was constant. Foreboding. It grew louder. The pitch dropped slowly. Then it grew even louder. The pitch 
          continuing to lower. Then louder. Now enough to disturb the field. The animals began to flee one by one, the bugs retreating into the dirt, then suddenly a great flash filled the sky before rapidly 
          engulfing the field.<br><br>
          it was a nuke.<br>
          the animals all died.<br><br>
          the end.
