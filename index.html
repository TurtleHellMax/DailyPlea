            <span class="section">
                As the sky parted once more, the trees began to slow their sway and the birds' chirps once again became audible.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                The grass, soaked with the sky's moisture, was greener than ever and greeted all those who crawled up from beneath its roots.
            </span>

            <span class="section">
                The air was humid, but not so much so that it was overwhelming, or hard to breathe. Just enough to mix up breathing in from out.
            </span>

            <span class="section">
                It was peaceful. Nature was as it should be. Natural.
            </span><br>

            <span class="section">
                Then a faint whistling sound could be heard. It was unlike any native bird's whistle... It was constant. Foreboding.
            </span>

            <span class="section">
                It grew louder. The pitch dropped slowly.
            </span>

            <span class="section">
                Then it grew even louder. The pitch continuing to lower.
            </span>

            <span class="section">
                Then louder. Now enough to disturb the field.
            </span>

            <span class="section">
                The animals began to flee one by one, the bugs retreating into the dirt, then suddenly a great flash filled the sky before rapidly engulfing the field.
            </span><br><br>

            <span class="section">
                it was a nuke.
            </span><br><br>

            <span class="section">
                the animals all died.
            </span><br><br><br>

            <span class="section">
                the end.
