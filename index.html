                Today I saw a frog!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                That isn't normally super remarkable, but you don't see them very often within the castle walls!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                (Alive, I mean.)
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                And yet here he was! It was especially funny to imagine how he could have gotten in.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I pictured him leaping over the wall in one bound, or using his webbed feet to suction-cup his way to the top haha!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I realised the answer was probably less exciting once I followed him around and found a small hole in the wall, but it's still funny to imagine being the frog, you know?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                What drives something like that to take such an enormous departure from it's normal day-to-day life?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Maybe he got into a fight with his frog wife.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Or perhaps he was banished from his frog kingdom!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                OR maybe he was looking for a true-love's kiss to turn himself back into the prince and reclaim his rightful throne HAHA!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I opted not to verify that last one though :P.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I dont want a face covered in frog slime, and while I dont THINK frogs carry disease, I'm DEFINITELY not taking any chances!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                But yeah, that was just something funny and unusual.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Other than that, it was more of the same.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Sadly, I didn't get any time to work on my potions today, but I DID hear about a new shipment of nightcaps coming in tomorrow, so maybe I'll try doing something with those soon!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Okay, that's all! Goodnight journal :)
