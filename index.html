            <span class="section">
                I'm set to be a knight.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That much was clear to me about as soon as I crept out of my mother's womb.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I'm not sure I want to be...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                My whole life, I've been made to practice my knightly duties.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Horse riding every week, sword practice every other day, and that's all on top of my standard education.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It gets to be a bit much at times.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I have no say in the matter, it seems.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I remember back when I was much younger... Perhaps in my first year of elementary schooling? Yes, somewhere around that time.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I asked my mother why the other kids didn't have to attend fencing lessons.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I don't even recall her response, but I still retain this much, because it was the first time I had even considered being a "knight,"  an unusual occupation.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It seemed as though the second I started stumbling around on two feet, I was fitted with training weights.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think it's quite selfish and dehumanizing for parents to treat their children like they have me.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Birthing their child with the sole purpose of raising a knight, regardless of who they are as an individual, is quite cruel, is it not?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But it's what was done, and so, become I knight, I must.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's that, or get banished from my own home.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Suffice to say, my relationship with my parents isn't ideal.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I often get the impression that they "love" my upcoming knighthood more than they do *me*.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Lord, it seems much sadder when scribed...
