                I'm the trash man.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Kids see me in the street- even off work, and go, "Oh, look, it's the trash man!"
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's alright...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                They're not wrong, are they?..
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's interesting, though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Being the trash guy of the kingdom makes me simultaneously one of the MOST recognizable people in the place, while also being the least glamorous.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When people think of being a trash guy, they don't see it as a first-pick career; that's for sure.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And it doesn't help my reputation when I smell like trash all day.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's not MY fault!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                What am I supposed to do? Go wash up after EVERY STOP?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                NO! OF COURSE NOT!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So I stay smelly 'til I get home for the day.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Then I finally get to clean off.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But that's the majority of people's experience with me.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Interacting with the smelly guy in town...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The pay's surprisingly good though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm not the richest guy in town by any means, but I get paid probably as much as the old gravedigger, Troy.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                He and I... We're pretty much in the same boat.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Weirdos doing the 'gross' jobs.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Now that I think about it... He might get paid a bit more than I do, though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You know, I don't even think most people KNOW what I do with the trash!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They see me take it, but I'm pretty sure they're clueless past that point.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You wanna know what I do once I load up my wagon? I'll tell ya'...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I take the trash, and I put it in this great big hole.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And this hole is BIG.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                And old too.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In fact, I've been doing this for... what? 20-some odd years? And I've used the same hole the entire time!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's starting to get up there in height, but I reckon it's got another 10-20 years in it at least.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I'm serious, I load the trash into a wagon, wheel it outside the castle walls to the hole in the back, and dump.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's hard work, but I admit... It's not very sophisticated.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I don't know what they're gonna do once I retire...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                They'll probably find SOMEBODY but... Well...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Actually I don't know what I'LL do once I retire...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Man...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's gonna be hard to live down the trash man reputation...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                ...
            </span><br>

                I really don't know *what* I'll do...
