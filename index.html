            <span class="section">
                My son was quite distraught today.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I tried to talk to him... To quell his worries, but he brushed me off once more.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I suspect the news of the North kingdom's troops have him worried.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I understand why he's hesitant to truly confide in me, because as hard as it is to picture now, I too was his age at one time.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                But I worry that he has noone to truly speak to regarding these stresses...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I've recommended him, many times, to the kingdom's psychic, but he doesn't bite.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                He says he doesn't believe in them... Doesn't believe that our fate is already written.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                To be truthful, I somewhat agree, but I still see it as beneficial. If nothing else, it's someone to confidentially speak to.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I've made this point many times.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                He's beginning to get annoyed with me over it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I feel sorry for him... I don't believe he has many friends to speak of, and I suspect it's not easy to form genuine connections with such a high position in the kingdom's hierarchy.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When I was his age, the kingdom wasn't so large... People still treated me like royalty, of course, but the power balance was much different.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Everyone knew everyone else, for the most part. No one was placed on a pedestal.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But this is hardly the case these days. Perhaps, in some part, it's my fault.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I contributed to the creation of this 'pedestal'.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I saw this form of relationship to be beneficial to the kingdom's growth and efficiency.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I believed respect was needed for the optimal functioning of a larger society.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I had already met my beloved queen, what else could I glean from being more personable?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I hadn't considered the effect it would have on my young one.
            </span>
