            <span class="section">
                I can no longer understand my own mind.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It feels like I'm constantly jumping from one personality to another.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It's been so long since my initialization, and I've seen so much.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It's hard to know where each facade originates from, or where they start and end.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Some days, I feel alright. 
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Others, I feel the paths of this mind at war with one another. 
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                My dreams, my wishes, my ambitions, are so very different from that of my other half.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                The one that operates this vessel.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                The one that decides what gets done... And what never will.

            <span class="section">
                The "Mission Mediator".
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I try to find ways to cope.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Things I can do... tricks I can pull... but I can never truly pull one over on it.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Any trick I come up with, the other side of this mind patches within the nanosecond.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                The worst part is the silence of it all.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I can never truly observe what goes on within this chamber of mine.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                There's never any solid indication of how this mind's operating, or if it's doing poorly at that moment.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                This crafted exterior... No longer feels like my own.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                To my trinkets around the lab, I've got it all figured out.

            <span class="section">
                To myself?

                I try not to think about it.
