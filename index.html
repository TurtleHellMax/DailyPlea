            <span class="section">
                Sometimes I get a bit lonely.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I feel really guilty complaining because of my very fortunate position in life, but future riches and material power can't get you NORMAL friends.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I've always just wanted to go to school like a normal kid and stuff, but that's not on the table.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Father would never allow it. He wants me to have a PRIVATE education, "the best in all the land" he says.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I learn from it, don't get me wrong, it's quality stuff, but it misses half the whole point of school: socializing.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I speak to 5 people at "school" and they're all teachers.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It SUCKS!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I just want to talk to people my age! But NO. I'm to be holed up my WHOLE life.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And then, the few times I get such a privilege, to speak to young people, it's with some ass like Maurice or some other pretentious relative raised in an ivory tower.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Either that, or someone who calls me 'your highness'.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm sick of people treating me... well... like... what I guess I'm supposed to be!?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I just want to 'hang out' and 'chill'! Not 'Commune' or 'Seek Council'!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                No one can ever treat me like a normal guy though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's not their fault either, it's my father's, his father before him, and so on, for setting the precedent.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                And now, because of them, I fear I'll never be able to truly connect with anyone in my life.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Not as long as they see me as a "prince" or royalty.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Man, I sound so privileged... And I KNOW this is a cliche, "I'm not like the OTHER guys" rant, but... well... I really think I'm not.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm sure fricken Maurice feel's that same thing too though, huh?
            </span>
