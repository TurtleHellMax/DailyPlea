            <span class="section">
                I don't know all that much about flowers, but I know that this thing IS one...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's got no leaves at its base, no green in its stem...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                No petals for that matter!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And yet, I'm certain it must be a flower.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                My mind says it is! Something about it...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The way it glistens...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The way it blooms...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You can classify it just by glancing at it, and yet looking further will do nothing but leave you with doubts...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It appears every full moon, completely vanishing between cycles.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It violates all laws that I'M aware of, and yet there it is.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Reliably so.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The first time I saw it, I was utterly entranced by its shimmering form.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So much so, that I moved my hand to caress it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Immediately, as my hand made contact with the shape, I was stung.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I reeled back in an instant, but a pain shot through my arm regardless.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Upon my fingertip was a bruise of pure black.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The aching lasted days...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The color still never fully returning to my extremity.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                My fingertip never really TOUCHED anything, though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In fact, I believe it made contact... with NOTHING, in the most literal sense.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I believe this apparition, not to be a material shape at all...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Rather, I hypothesize it to be a complete LACK of matter.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The space it occupied was positively FREEZING, completely lacking heat.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I believe that's why it blackened my complexion and seared my nerves.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I still can't explain HOW it comes to be, though...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I haven't shown it to anyone else...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Not that I really have anyone worth presenting to...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I get this feeling it'll stop appearing if I tried...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It feels... Almost shy...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I've talked to it before.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I know, not very scientific...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                But it listened.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I swear it did...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It shifted ever so slightly to the vibrations of my voice...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It makes me wonder what it's thinking...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Does it think?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Does it know what it is?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Does it... experience things at all?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Am I just personifying a bizarre scientific anomaly?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Most likely...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But still... I can't shake this feeling that it appears...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                for ME...
