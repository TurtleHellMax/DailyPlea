            <span class="section">
                I didn't really get a chance to say anything at today's meeting.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Like always.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I would be annoyed, but I don't think I really had much to say anyway.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The whole scare with the valley's detection instruments going off inexplicably was exciting at first, but like all things 'politics', has grown tiresome rather quickly.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The triggering was concluded to be no more than a rabid device on the fritz...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                So why can't we be done with the whole thing yet?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They say they want to be "thorough", and ensure that it doesn't happen again, but I'm sorry, isn't that the apprentice and his team's job?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                He isn't done looking into it yet, so why are we having this meeting NOW?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They just spent the whole time reestablishing everything everyone already knew, adding nothing to the conversation but whines and groans.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Man, I hate politics.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The dinner sucked too.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They only served appetizers the whole time, because it was treated like a lunch meeting, despite spanning long past 5.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I ended up personally requesting a chicken and that was good, I guess.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Everytime we have any meetings, though (moreso ones where I actually desire to contribute), It's led almost entirely by the king and his most "important" guest, with them either competing for a medal in a tangent contest, or digging loudly into their food, making it incredibly awkward to try and add my piece, even in the rare event that silence finally returns to the room.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I never feel invited to the conversation...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I feel more like a mere spectator.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I've complained to father before, and he's just said what he always does: "That's just how it is!"
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                He loves to tell me that I'll get to lead the discussions once I'm king, but how am I expected to do that without any practice to speak of?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's not like any of it's out of his control either!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I don't think it's a lot to ask for him to simply enquire, "What do YOU think?" when a topic I CLEARLY display interest in comes up!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Whatever.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Tomorrow I have yet another meeting to look forward to.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                This time, regarding the parade budget.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Not the parade itself!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's budget.
            </span><br><br>
            <span class="section">
                Yay.
            </span>
