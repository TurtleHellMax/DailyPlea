            <span class="section">
                I checked up on the ruins again today.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Still nothing.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I should be glad I suppose, but who am I kidding?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I crave action!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's been god know's how long since I've engaged in combat!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Or engaged in much of anything for that matter...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Jeez.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I believe the last time I fought... No... Yeah... I guess it was... Wow... So it really HAS been a long time...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I still keep busy though.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I work on various little projects.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Prepare endlessly for the fateful day I'm needed.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I guess, when something's so inevitable, you'd prefer it come sooner rather than later though, haha.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I shouldn't hope for that.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                There's always a chance that I fail.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Actually, I probably don't consider that as much as I should...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But to be honest, I really AM a bit disappointed when I don't find anything.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I really SHOULD be greatful, I know, but the fire in my heart has yet to diminish, despite everything else fading long ago.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Hey, at least I'm doing better than the other guy though, right?
