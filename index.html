            <span class="section">
                Apparently the northern kingdom's finally making a grab for ultimate power!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Well, "allegedly" anyway...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But let's face it, it doesn't matter if they really are or aren't! I'm still getting payed!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I've been getting a BUNCH of knights coming in here, looking for custom gear to get ready for the big war, and- oh my GOD they never know ANYTHING about armor.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Not a thing!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If I wanted to, I could hand 'em a raw aluminum chest piece with chainmail leggings and tell 'em they were ready to take an arrow!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                And they'd pay 5x it's worth!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm telling you, these guys are seriously dopey!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Listen, I don't do that, but I really think I could!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In the end, I set most of 'em up with the standard stuff:
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                An alloyed-steel main-piece here, an aluminum chainmail underbody set there... And don't get it twisted, I only ever charge 'em label price!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                What can I say? I have a reputation to uphold here ;)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I gotta really start stocking up on standard sets though, because oh boy they're just gonna keep on comin'!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I don't think this shop's seen this much action since the establishing wars! (If my ancestors were even settled here back then!)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I know Ramon's gettin plenty of business too, they go right on over to him the moment they step out of my shop!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (I may or may not mention his name a bit, but I'd never tell HIM that!)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                For as much as I despise him, I gotta say he's good at what he does, even IF his creations are the polar enemy of mine!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'd be doing my customers a selfish disservice NOT to mention him!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I hope he's got enough swords to go around... I'd hate to see him miss out on business because of poor planning!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Because then I'd probably have to hear about it, y'know?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                He'll be fine.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In fact, if I know him, he'll be WAY BETTER than fine.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Hell, he's probably making more sales than me right now!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                What am I doing still writing all this? I gotta get back to work!
            </span>
