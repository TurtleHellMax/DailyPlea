            <span class="section">
                It rained today!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I guess that means spring's rolling in...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I like the rain.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's a little inconvenient at times, but it's quite nice to watch and listen to...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                when shelter's nearby, that is.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                According to legend, rain is a celebration of freedom.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It says that rain is really the angels' tears of joy at our escape from the underground.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I guess I can see why they'd think that; Not much rain underground, is there?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And rain droplets are an awful lot like tears.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                For a lot of religious people, this makes rain a fun, nice event...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But for other folks, it's nothing but a hindrance, like I said.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And with the leaks that spring up in roofs around the kingdom, I can certainly see where they're coming from...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But it's still undeniable that it's a pretty sight...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And with magic's volatility in the rain, it's the best time for *me* to get the most bang for my buck out of my alchemy supplies.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That does come with its downsides though, with some of the most bizarre and chaotic mystical events of all time having occurred during storms...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Overall, I'd say today was a pretty good day for rain, though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I brewed up a few healing potions while I watched the water droplets drip drop along my windowsill, and didn't find any new holes in the roof!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                'Couldn't really ask for a better storm :)
