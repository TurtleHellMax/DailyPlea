      The man took any job he could get, for he was a scoundrel and that meant they came few and far in between. The man was quite adept at looking busy despite doing very little of anything productive. This could be viewed as a skill more than anything else, much like acting is most certainly a skill. Especially considering how little our society rewards actual productivity... In that way, I suppose it may as well be the greatest skill you could have! But the man didn't ever consider such frivolities himself. He didn’t ponder much at all, for he valued few things in life more than his wife and football. If you were to ask people what makes for a successful and well-lived life, they'd mostly respond “happiness,” but I believe this man is living proof that this tired, old answer just isn't true, because look at this guy: He's truly happy, happier than you and I'll probably ever be dear reader, and he's done absolutely nothing to become so. He doesn't create, doesn't work much, doesn't introspect... he does nothing, and is content in that. Perhaps you and I are being a bit too cynical though… maybe we're just jealous of his contented demeanor… No, that can’t be it. Look at this guy! The most risk he's ever taken is trying cilantro on his pancakes! He's an absolute buffoon! He can’t be living life better than us! Right?! Anyways…<br>your order comes out to $28.83, you can pull through to the next window now.
