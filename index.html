                Lilypads make for a mighty potent seasoning, but their health perks beat their bitter taste!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Or so I was told, anyway!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Apparently, eatin' one lilypad's edge a year (roughly 100 cm), can keep you from developing both hemorrhoids, AND rectal cancer.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Now I don't know how true that is, and it IS an unpleasant amount of lilypad to eat, but I'll tell you this: I've never seen it NOT work!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And everyone in town does it!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Ever since *I* started feeding them, that is :P.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You wanna know how I do it? (Without them spitting the meal back out?)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Mushrooms.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Toadstools, caps, whatever you wanna call 'em, but they DIRECTLY counter the flavor!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And they don't take over the dish either!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (Plus, they're in abundant supply in this town thanks to Cliff XD)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I learned this trick from my mother, and she from her mother, and then her from her mother before her, and so on, but it goes like this:
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                1 gram of lily, and 2 of cap. If you put any more than that, you start tasting the mushrooms, but any less and you'll start gettin' complaints of pad.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But if you do EXACTLY as my momma instructed, you'll get a remedy with absolutely NO discernable flavor!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                AT ALL!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I find Red Rembosha Toadstools work the best for getting that 'no flavor at all', but most others will work just as well, albeit with slightly different portions.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Alright, that's my cooking tip of the day!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I sprinkle this combo on almost all my meals alongside some spice, and never once gotten a complaint!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (Or a hemorrhoid for that matter! XD)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Feel free to try it out yourself, and let me know how it works out!
