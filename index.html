            <span class="section">
                The kingdom began constructing its grand wall today.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's quite a sad day for many.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Looking out upon the sun's set and greenery from one's window will now be but a bittersweet memory for members of the castle...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The comings and goings of the castle are promised to be permitted freely, but it now makes these once-everyday glories a chore.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Having to plan and arrange to visit things that once came to you is an awful loss.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                All in the name of security, claims the king.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                A necessary loss for the safety of our people...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But *I* never saw brutality directed at us before...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                From what I recall, it was only ever US beating upon others...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I might even think the king to be projecting his violent rule upon the rulers of our neighbors...
            </span><br><br>
            <span class="section">
                But this thought is now considered blasphemy, is it not?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Therefore, I shall take back what I have just scrolled!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In fact, I shall erase the very thoughts from my mind!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That IS what you command of me, is it not, my ruler?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I shall scrub my consciousness of any and all doubt or criticism of my dear god-chosen hegemony!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Long live the king!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Please, forgive my previous ramblings...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I prefer the crusty castle wall to anything that dirty nature ever had to offer!
