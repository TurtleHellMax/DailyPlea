            <span class="section">
                This cell doesn't get any better.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They tell you that you'll get more and more used to it the longer you're in here, but... I'm finding that to be untrue.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But what do I know? I've only been here for 10 YEARS!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Or was it 11?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                At least 10. That much is for sure...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You know, I'm real sorry...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I told them that before they put me in here.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I say it everytime I see anyone from the outside.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And it's the truth!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Well... mostly...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Truthfully, I think I'm only sorry that I ended up here...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                If there was no punishment, I don't think I'd be very sorry at all.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's not like it was an accident.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                No. It was on purpose.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Planned even.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'd say the bastard had it coming... But no...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                That's "Unacceptable" right? "Inhumane" as they say.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think, as a fellow human being, *I* can judge what IS or ISN'T HUMANE!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                No one cares when you verbally assault someone!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                People can even empathize with some light violence!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But the second you take it a hair further, it becomes a crime punishable by life in prison or death!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I just can't understand why people get so worked up over it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                This guy did bad things to others, so I did ONE "bad" thing back.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's debatable if it was even a bad thing to begin with!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                My ONE action, prevented every other bad thing the guy was gonna do with his life.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I SHOULD be celebrated as a hero!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If the guy's "bad thing" was also murder, then I would be.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Because THAT'S where the line is arbitrarily drawn.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Pfff. What a joke.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So now here I am.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Locked away forever.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Because of these people's unrelenting haywire and arbitrary "emotion".
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Illogical nitwits. Feral apes...
            </span><br><br>
            <span class="section">
                You don't get used to the cage. That's for sure.
