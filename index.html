            <span class="section">
                Today, there was another big argument between Ramon and Terry.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It was once again about the importance of offense vs defense.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I tried to intervene, like always, and, like always, they ignored me.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Then, once again, LIKE ALWAYS, they ended the argument in disagreement and each stormed off, neither side budging on the quarrel in any way.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I guess when you only get like, 1 customer a week, you gotta fill your time doing other worthless stuff, like fightin' over nothin'.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                They're both just meatheads I tell you, with Ramon only really bein' slightly smarter.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I really think the argument is in absolute vein, and I try to explain that to them! Both sword and shield are necessary!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It's ridiculous to say otherwise, but everytime I say that, it just stirs the pot more, and they both get upset with me!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                "Well we KNOW it's a mix of both!", they say, "But which one's MORE IMPORTANT?".
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I tell them, "It depends!" and then they go back to blabbering.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It gets nobody nowhere and never resolves, so why do it?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Secretly, I think it's just because they wanna talk to each other, but they're both too dumb to start a normal conversation, so they default to startin' fights.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                They should just go take a walk together or something, rather than rile up the whole town.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Plus, it makes me look bad when I cant stop it!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Anyways, I guess it's at least exciting. Without it, the most eventful part of my week would be finding Ella's cats when they get out.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I'm greatful for the peace though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Gotta remember that.
            </span>
