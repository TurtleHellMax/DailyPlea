            <span class="section">
                It's no secret that I spend most of my time in the cafe, but what most people don't realize, is that I do so, to write my book...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Okay, actually EVERYONE might know that by now, thanks to my over-active chatterbox, but they still don't know what it's about!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Okay, well they might also know that..?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I DON'T TALK ABOUT IT *THAT* MUCH THOUGH, OKAY?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Whatever!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                My hook's gone! I'll get to my point.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I find, that I have a hard time *committing*.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                To my book, I mean.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I've started, and subsequently abandoned more books than I've written chapters at this point!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Wait, is that even possible?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Does it count as a chapter if I don't finish it..?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                WHATEVER. NOT THE POINT.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                THE POINT IS: I get sidetracked.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                (Gee, could you tell!?)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Every time I try to crank out a story, half way through I think of a BETTER ONE, and lose the motivation to finish THAT one.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I mean, I don't think I'm ever WRONG, the next book idea IS often better, but at what point is it just good enough?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Should I just stick out the sub-par book? Not that it's really an option, because, like I said, I LOSE MOTIVATION.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                ...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Maybe I should just write short stories...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                ANYWAY: Then, even when I HAVE motivation, I have a hard time committing to the story I write!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The characters are never compelling enough, I'm never certain what I want to name them, who I want to die, or how the story's gonna end...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I mean, it's easy to just say, "It doesn't matter! You should just finish a book for the sake of finishing!"
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Or, "The audience won't ever think about it as hard as you do!"
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I don't write for the AUDIENCE! I write for MYSELF!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And if it's not good enough for ME...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                What's the point?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Oh damn it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I just thought of another story idea.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Oh no...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                God...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                DAMN IT!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Well... Back to work...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm gonna try to stick this one out.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I SWEAR I WILL.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                COME ON JOHN!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                YOU GOT THIS.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                STAY FOCUSED!
