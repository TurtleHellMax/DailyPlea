            <span class="section">
                Okay, the horses around here are OUT of CONTROL.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I told the Royal guard that I've submitted complaints, and still, nothing is done.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I've had it up to HERE!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I live at the end of a cul-de-sac, so we get a lot of foot traffic from people trying to turn around in carriages and just riding horses in general. WHICH IS FINE.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I tolerate the stomping and clopping outside the window!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I get it!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I knew what I was signing up for when I moved here!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But what I could have NEVER expected is the sheer amount that horses CRAP.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                WHILE THEY'RE WALKING!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And for some reason, they all get the SUDDEN URGE to crap, RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY DOOR.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                WHY?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I DON'T KNOW!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'VE HAD IT.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I EITHER WANT THE TRASH MAN TO PICK IT UP, THE RIDERS TO, OR FOR THE HORSES TO GO AWAY ENTIRELY!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I proposed this to the king's little assistant, and STILL haven't heard back from him.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So, then I figured it must've been TOO MUCH to ask for *him* to come up with a solution, so I drew up a plan of my own.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I suggested they add a simple curb before the coldesac, and shift the whole thing further from my house, BECAUSE AT LEAST THEN I WOULDN'T SMELL IT FROM MY KITCHEN... And still nothing!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I have half a mind to storm into the castle and speak to the king myself at this point!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I've started yelling at the horsemen to pick up after themselves when I see it, and for the most part, they do (with only a few ignoring me), but I can't do that all day!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So some always slips through the cracks!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think tomorrow I'm gonna make Tom go out there and put up a sign or something, because this is RIDICULOUS.
