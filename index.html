                The birds are always so beautiful when they migrate in the springtime.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Their wings waft so rhythmically, gracefully gliding across the blue ocean of cloud above.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They flap and they glide, all taking up stride, never to divide.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I really like 'em!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Sometimes I wish people migrated too.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Wouldn't it be nice to get a change of scenery every year without having to make new friends?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And wouldn't it be wonderful to go on a journey with everyone you've ever met?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Collectively pursuing one big goal, with all the time in the world to enjoy each other's company?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                *I* think it would be.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Just imagine the pitter patter of the whole Kingdom walking in unison toward a horizon, growing ever closer to a new home...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Finally settling down upon our field of hope...

                I bet people would get along better too.

                If they spent more time with each other, I mean.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And if they spent more time helping one another conquer the same road.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But it's just a dream...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Sometimes I prefer the people of my daydreams to the ones I'm faced with in real life...

                I still think that even my worst customers are good at heart, though.

            <span class="section">
                Once, I had to serve the rudest lady I'd ever met.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                She was snapping at me, got frustrated when I asked her to clarify what size side-dish she wanted...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I was pretty frustrated with her... Not that I let it show...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But when I came back with her dish, she was slumped over.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                As I approached I heard muffled whimpers.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                She was weeping.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I stopped and waited a minute to see if she'd recover on her own, but it started to look like by the time she finally did, I'd get scolded for her cold food.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I decided to take the arrowhead.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I approached calmly, set the food down on the table, and asked her politely what was wrong...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                As soon as I did, she looked up and into my eyes... no, my very soul... with a look of despair like I'd never seen before...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Then she hugged me...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Embracing me, she muffled out a sincere apology for her behavior earlier.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Then, she confessed the real cause of her state...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Her husband had passed just a day prior...
            </span><br><br>
            <span class="section">
                'Point is... sure, not every bad action has it's excuse, but it damn well has it's explanation.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And what more can you do but apologize and work on being better?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Even the worst of the worst have their root-trauma.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Imagine if I had mirrored her attitude back at her before?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That would have been AWFUL in hindsight, huh?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Too often though, I see people do just that.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                They justify it with a, "fair's fair" mentality, but reciprocating negativity will surely never resolve anything.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You should never waste your time adding fuel to an unpleasant fire.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                These people don't need to be yelled at and told they're wrong. They know they're wrong!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They need help.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They need a hug.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And most importantly?
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                They need their side of extra large fries.
