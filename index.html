            <span class="section">
                I don't care much fer outsiders y'here?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's why I was truly peeved off when I dun saw that green girl come into town.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                She looked like nothing but trubble. She had 'er WILD pink hare and, well... if I'm to be purfectly honest, I din't like it one bit!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                But after she came into ma shop and askd me about my mushroom selection, I realized it's true what them folks say about bookcovers:
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Never use 'em!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                She was sharp as a tack I'll tell you hwat!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                She knew all there was to know about them red mushrooms with the white spots, the blue mushrooms with the star tops, them yeller fellers with the blue roots... I tell you, she knew 'em
                all!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (Not more then me by any stretch, but she knew more than any other mushroom connisewer I ever did meet!)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But it was her jenuine interest in the topic that got me most!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                She wasn't just asking about 'em to prove she knew 'em, she was askin' cuz she wanted to know em' more better-like!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I told her every bit I knew from the many centurys I done walked up on this here globe, and she just kept on askin'!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It was the best conversation Ive done had in decades I tell you hwat!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Yeah... She's an alright girl that one... She's alright...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Now I done started reading up on the mush rooms I don't know dat much on just fer her! (Even if my memry don't work too well these days heh.)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I look forward to every mornin' cuz I know it's a day she might swing by.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                She truly brought the life back to an old timer like myself...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                For as much as we old folks complain about this here jenerashun, I think she singlehandedly proves they'll be just fyne...
