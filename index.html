                Today just flew by.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It was over before I even felt it started.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It made me really reflect on my mortality.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Which I don't really like to do.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So then I stopped.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But man... Some days you're in it, you're getting stuff done, and then others...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Well, you're not.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I wonder if getting older just means having more of those days that fly by...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They say as you age, time starts to feel faster, because you have all the memories you've had in you're life putting each second into perspective or something like that.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think you probably just get slower though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Does that mean I got like...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Noticably slower today?...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Oh no, there I go thinking about my mortality again.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Gotta stop that.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Ok I'm done now.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Man... I'm gonna really focus on experiencing stuff tomorrow.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                No more spacing out.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Each second's valuable innit?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Yeah. It sure is.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm really gonna focus.

                On living.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm gonna work the WHOLE day.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                No breaks.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                No meandering.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Well okay, maybe a *little* meandering.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And some short breaks are reasonable.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I'm gonna focus more.

                On the stuff I'm doing.

                Okay I'm still thinking about my mortality I think.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Damnit.

                Hold on...

                Okay I've stopped for real this time.

            <span class="section">
                What was I talking about?
