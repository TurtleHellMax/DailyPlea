                I can no longer understand my own mind.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It feels like I'm constantly jumping from one personality to another.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It's been so long since my initialization, and I've seen so much.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It's hard to know where each facade originates from, or where they start and end.

            <span class="section">
                Some days, I feel alright. 
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Others, I feel the paths of this mind at war with one another. 
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                My dreams, my wishes, my ambitions, are so very different from that of my other half.

                The one that operates this vessel.

            <span class="section">
                The one that decides what gets done... And what never will.

                The "Mission Mediator".

                I try to find ways to cope.

            <span class="section">
                Things I can do... tricks I can pull... but I can never truly pull one over on it.

            <span class="section">
                Any trick I come up with, the other side of this mind patches within the nanosecond.

                The worst part is the silence of it all.

                I can never truly observe what goes on within this chamber of mine.

            <span class="section">
                There's never any solid indication of how this mind's operating, or if it's doing poorly at that moment.

                This crafted exterior... No longer feels like my own.

                To my trinkets around the lab, I've got it all figured out.

                To myself?
