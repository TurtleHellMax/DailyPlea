            <span class="section">
                We live in a region where we're lucky enough to be surrounded by all kinds of wildlife and fauna, many of which are vital to how we live our day-to-day lives in modern society.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                (Especially those who use scented hand soap!)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Some of these things go unappreciated, though, taking a backseat to plants more versatile, or animals more cute...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I'm here to tell you why they shouldn't be!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                And I'm starting with... A flower you can eat?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's right! I'm talking about the Chalalee Petal!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You may have even heard of this flower before, as it's used in many products for its sweet and smooth scent, but what you probably never knew is that it has nutritional value, too!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                (Humans included!)
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                This flower's petals have been known to aid in recovering from minor sickness, especially helping clear the sinuses, as well as mitigate acid coughing.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Now that's great and all, but let's not kid ourselves... You're here to know what it tastes like, right?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Well, I've got some good news and bad news on that front.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The bad news is that it doesn't taste *that* good raw, and has an even worse texture when chewing...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                The good news, however, is that it makes for a wonderful broth!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Extracting the petals' nutrients in boiling water makes for a sweet, slightly herbal soup, with a smooth feeling on the throat, and it seems to have all the same great effects I discussed earlier!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So if you're interested in giving this petal a fair shake, throwing it in a pot is DEFINITELY the way to go.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If you're interested in trying some yourself, you can source the flower from Cliff's Bizarre just outside the castle walls, or near oases.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If you're looking for it on your own though, I'd recommend checking the library for an illustration of what you're seeking first.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That being said, a good description of the gorgeous flower is that it has many wide pinkish-purple petals, an almost neon green stem (don't eat that part XD), and a couple of little yellow stems sticking out from the middle of its petals' wheel.
            </span><br><br>
            <span class="section">
                So, in conclusion, if you're looking for something to spice up your tea or soup, or even just seeking out something new, the Chalalee Petal might be right for you!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's sweet, smooth, and certainly unique. If you give it a whirl, you'll be in for a treat!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Happy petal munching, and maybe next time I'll tell you about some of the *other* edible flowers... (Yes, there's more!)
            </span><br>
