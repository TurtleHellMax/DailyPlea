      The man took any job he could get, for he was a scoundrel and they came very far and few in between. The man was quite adept at looking busy despite doing very little of anything productive. This could be viewed as a skill more than anything else, much like acting is most certainly a skill, and considering how little capitalism rewards actual productivity, it may as well be the greatest skill you could have. But the man didn't consider such frivolties himself. He didnt ponder much at all, for he valued few things in life more than his wife and football. If you were to ask someone what makes for a successful and well lived life, they'd mostly respond. "happiness", but I believe this man is living proof that this tired old answer is just not true, because look at this guy: he's truly happy, happier than you and I'll probably ever be, dear reader, and he's done absolutely nothing to become so. He doesn't create, doesn't work much, doesn't introspect... he does nothing, and is content in that. Perhaps you and I are being a bit too cynical though... Maybe we're just jealous of his contented demeanor... No that cant be it. Look at this guy! The most risk he's ever taken is trying cilantro on his pancakes! He's an absolute bafoon! He cant be living life better than us! Right? Anyways... you're order comes out to $28.83, you can pull through to the next window now.</p>
