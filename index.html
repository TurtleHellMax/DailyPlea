            <span class="section">
                What's it like to die?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's a bit ghoulish, but one has to wonder...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                For almost everyone, it's not long until its inevitable occurrence... So what comes after it?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I think these days, most people just say; nothing does.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And if you ask me? That's what most things point to...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But there are plenty of things in our world that we still can't explain...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Fantastical, magical, terrific things that defy all logic...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So who's to say death is any different?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's what nearly all old religions lean into.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                If you asked a follower of The Ancient Scripture, at least how it's translated today, they might tell you that after death, there is a heaven for those who output more than they take in life...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And a hell for those who fail to, with the specificities of both realms being widely vague.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But if you were to ask a follower of the modern plaquereds, they would heavily disagree.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                While agreeing heaven exists, they insist that there is no hell, and that if you fail to generally live for the sake of "goodness", as their teachings encourage, you are not punished, but rather confronted by the heavenly people.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                There, you are taught the error of your ways, and then reincarnated to, I guess, try again.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The ideals of both religions, while seemingly similar on the surface (be good) are actually quite divisive, with the Ancient's believing in a one true ruler / God, and that you exist to work and improve the earth, and the Modern followers believing that there are many heavenly figures, and that you exist merely "to do your best" and "be good" leaving it mostly up to the follower to decide what falls under those umbrellas.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They especially differ when it comes to punishment of the damned.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                While modern scripture heavily embodies ideals of rehabilitation and redemption, the Ancient's just believe in damnation, with your current worldly life being your one and only shot to get into the good place.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Personally, I don't believe in either of these, as I think they're both a little far-fetched and don't always follow logic or history when analyzed, but I guess I most closely align with the ideals presented by the Modern Plaquereds.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I live my life trying to be good, and live for myself and others, helping people wherever it doesn't overwhelmingly cost me (which it never does), and believe that people aren't really good or bad by default, being almost always redeemable if bad (with few exceptions).
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So what happens after death then?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I don't know.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Nobody does.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's all based on blind faith!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So make it up!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                What do YOU want to happen?
            </span><br><br>
            <span class="section">
                Me personally? I'm okay if there's nothing else.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I live a good enough life here and now.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Eternity seems kind of miserable, no matter where it takes place ;)
