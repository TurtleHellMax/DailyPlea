            <span class="section">
                Alarm was raised earlier this week when troop movements were detected in the mountain range that divides this Kingdom from its Northern opposition.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The king responded to this unforeseen event by sending a scroll to the kingdom, seeking an explanation.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                A response has now been received.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The returning scroll was read yesterday, at nine O'clock that night, roughly 1 day after the first scroll reached it's Northern destination.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                According to our king, the response described the situation as a, "confusing" one, claiming that it had NOT made any troop movements within the specified region.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The Northern king politely attributed the alarm as no more than, "an error" in our kingdom's observation equipment.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The letter emphasized that they are still, "very happy" with the treaties currently in place, and do not plan on ever "act(ing) in a way that would jeaporadize the lasting peace [between the two kingdoms]."
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Our king has commented that the situation, "seems to be a misunderstanding, like (he) said", and that he's going to continue to work alongside the Northern Kingdom to, "resolve things".
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The king's apprentice, who originally detected the troop movements using various technological instruments, says they are still, "cautiously skeptical" of the opposing kingdom, but are dismissing this as an error in the systems used.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                He says they're attempting to replicate the issue to and resolve it, to prevent any further false-positives in the future.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The king finally stated that, "Tensions are returning to the baseline they've always been", and that this issue should be, "considered as good as resolved".
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                This story will be updated in the event that further relevant information is received.
            </span>
