                Did you know moss has measurable intellect? Seriously!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Assuming we're measuring intellect on the basis that it can solve a problem, statistically, given a problem, moss can solve it in a measurable amount of time, with measurable effort.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                For instance, if you were to ask a small patch of moss what 2+2 equals, and interpret the shape it grows into as the answer in integer form, in the incredibly unlikely, but still possible event it
                answers correctly, you could measure its intellect.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Even if it was wrong, you could measure how 'close' it was to being the shape of a 4!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                The vibrations of your voice as you ask technically effect the growth of the plant, satisfying an "input", the growth is the "processing", and the final shape it responds with is the "output".
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Now this isn't exclusive to moss, this silly observation applies to almost all things that move in a quantumly-random manner, but isn't that funny?...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I thought it was.

                Hey, you'd think about this stuff too if you were shackled to eternity.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Maybe I'll try this on my own patch in the corner while I wait.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                I'll report back if I get a response from him!
