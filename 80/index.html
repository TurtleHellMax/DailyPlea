            <span class="section">
                The need to be seen.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It oozes from each and every one of us, despite our attempts at sealant.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The purist of monks have only really learned to better conceal it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Everything we do can be traced back to the urge.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Even the lumberjack, dead set on isolating himself in the forest, finds solace in the rabbit's glances.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Many of us battle it, some dedicating ourselves to the fight, but none have ever succeeded.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The aftermath of each war leaves only a blight.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The embarrassment of every unconvincing denial etches itself into our membranes... and yet we persist.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                We never do come clean.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                We only downplay our feelings, refuse our urges, and convince ourselves of their passing.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But the need never goes.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It only lingers.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Forever an uninvited guest in our inescapable cortex.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Freedom can only be found from this captor, through surrender.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But true surrender would mean expulsion from the very group we seek cherishment from.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And so, we play this game.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                We fool ourselves into believing we are what we aren't, and aren't what we are, so the many can see us for what we wish we were.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Because at least then, we'll be seen... if only for a fleeting moment.
            </span>
