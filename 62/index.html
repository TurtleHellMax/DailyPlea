            <span class="section">
                My nose ran today.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                It ran all day.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                There's no one more appreciative of the ability to breathe freely, than someone damned to nasal constriction.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You only truly appreciate what you had, once it's lost, as they say...Â 
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I try to be grateful before I lose things, though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Sometimes, on normal days, when I have my health, the sun gently caresses my skin, and the clouds have dissipated, I realize what I have and take a moment to be grateful.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I know that in that moment, I will yearn for the time I have now later down the line.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I try to bottle up the feeling... save it for a day of rain.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                For a nose of stuff...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                For a light very dim...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I don't know if it really works...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But it does make me feel a little better about it all, in that fleeting moment that I've tried so desperately to save.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I know it won't last...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But maybe that's what makes it so valuable...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                In that way... I suppose I appreciate both the good and the bad...
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                at least once the bad has passed.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And man, do I wish this bad would pass.
            </span>
