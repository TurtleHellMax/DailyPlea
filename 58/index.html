            <span class="section">
                I am a man on a stick.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I was brought into this world by an enemy of crows, and now I serve forever to fight his battle.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I have no say in the matter.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                He dresses me however he likes, and as long as I'm around, crows never dare approach his harvest.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I wonder sometimes why I must exist.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I wonder why he can't simply share with the crows.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                He believes that they will eat all they can if he does, but surely there aren't THAT many crows around these parts...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's a big field.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I wonder where their urge to gorge themselves would have come from.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I wonder if, had they been given adequate food when nested, they would feel more sure of their next meal.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But I know he would have already considered these things... And I'm sure many crows are just born rotten.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                There is no other option but to go to war with them.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's why I exist.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                To scare away the crows...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The poor, irreparably hungry crows.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I'm sure they'll find another field to feed on, though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                One where the farmer isn't as cunning as Father.
