            <span class="section">
                "Odd" potatoes aren't very common, but you're bound to find at least a few every fresh harvest.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                These are potatoes that grow with a strange black skin and appear almost shriveled up, in a way.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The taste is a bit saltier, and their skin flakes off, but they're still pretty much edible.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Some people even prefer them!
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                *Some*...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Most are put off by their appearance or different taste, and stick out like a sore thumb when compared to the rest.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's why, oftentimes, farmers call alchemists to treat any sprouts found producing 'em.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                What these magicians do is they apply a potion known as Viscouna to the roots.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                This "cures" them in a way, forcing them to produce what is widely known as a "normal" potato.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                This treatment doesn't come without its drawbacks, though.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                When the plants are "fixed" with this stuff, their lifespan is reduced a bit, and they produce potatoes at only about half the speed of the rest.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The "Odd" plants also need regular treatments throughout their life, needing them more and more often as they continue receiving them.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You might wonder why they even bother, and while it may seem like a waste of resources on the surface, the potato is actually more valuable than the quantity of potion needed to "cure" it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You can't tell an "Odd" potato plant from a "normal" one until after they've set down roots and begun growing crop, and by that point, each one is worth about 50 copper pieces, with the drop of Viscouna costing 5, plus the Alchemist's labor rate.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So if you have more than like, 5 "Odd" plants, it ends up being worth the hassle.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's true that some farmers just rip them out, or even eat them on their own, but treatment seems to be the most common option from what I've seen.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Next time you see a potato farmer, you might ask him if he's got any "Odd" ones left over and give 'em a try!
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                You never know, they could just be a delicacy waiting to be discovered!
            </span>
