            <span class="section">
                Some people have no interest in the same things I do.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's something we come to terms with after being rejected from conversation as a kid.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                But do we ever really think about that?
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Everyone KNOWS they're different from one another, but for the most part, I feel like we all seem to project our thoughts and behaviors onto others, regardless.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's the only way we can begin to understand those around us.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                The only frame of reference we have for thought... is ourselves.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's the only person we can ever truly "know."
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                So I often think I have a solid grasp on my acquaintances' thought processes, but then they mention their complete and utter abstinence from literature, and my world is shattered.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I insist that they must not have read the right books, or that they did it wrong in some way, but no...
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                They read the same things I did, in the exact same fashion... and hated it.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                That's when I realized that there are some who exist, of which I will NEVER understand.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                Those who, from conception, prioritize and enjoy COMPLETELY different things than I do.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And that's okay... but it's very bizarre to think about.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's a little disturbing.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                Realizing the myopathy of my worldview.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                The narrow understanding I have of the human mind, and the impossibility of truly understanding its variants.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                It's good that people all think differently.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                But it's definitely weird.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                And certainly something I can never really *get*.
            </span>
            <span class="section">
                There's a beauty and a horror in that.
            </span><br>
            <span class="section">
                I suppose then, that there's an *art* in it.
            </span>
